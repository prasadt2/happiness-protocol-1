# Rewards Protocol 
Similar to how DropBox and Paypal powered their growth by offering rewards, rewards protocol is a general-purpose protocol where the next generation of companies can reward users for positive behavior: referrals, product actions, renewing subscriptions, and more.
What problem does this solve?

When Paypal offered $5 or DropBox offered 250MB to refer a friend, it accelerated their growth. 

These growth tactics have become stale. It takes a lot more money to drive growth and retention at scale. 
What are the core features and functionalities of the app?

With Rewards Protocol, companies offer crypto tokens as rewards when customers refer another customer, renew their subscription, or do any activity that increases retention. 

The Rewards protocol has two tokens (a work in progress):
Each company creates its own stablecoin which is then used to offer as rewards. The stablecoin value is defined and managed by the company. For instance, 100 KRISPYs could be worth $1. 
RWRD is the platform token that all company-specific stablecoins can be swapped to for the purposes of monetizing earned rewards. Depending on the market price of KUDO, 1 KRISPY will convert to $1 worth of RWRD tokens.
In addition to the protocol, the Rewards protocol platform will offer a web 2 application for the company to define the rules and administer the rewards program.
